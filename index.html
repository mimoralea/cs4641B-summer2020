<p>Instructor: Xin Chen</p>

<p>TA : Wendi Ren and Sheng Zhang</p>


Course overview
This course mainly introduces fundamental techniques in machine learning that widely used in data analysis. Our emphasis is on two parts: the underlying math as algorithms and their applications.
1.	Basic math for data science and machine learning
2.	Supervised learning
3.	Unsupervised learning
4.	Reinforcement learning
Prerequisite for this course include: 1) basic knowledge of probability, statistics, and linear algebra; 2) Basic programming experiences in python

Office hour and questions:
	Instructor: TBD (see canvas for update)
	Wendi: TBD (see canvas for update)
	Sheng Zhang: TBD (see canvas for update)
	Piazza will be the main place for any discussions or questions. Students are encouraged to discuss anything on this course, such as unclear parts on the lectures, assignments or corrections on the content. Note that one part of the grading attendance is based on the discussions in piazza.
	If there is something you do not want to talk in public, Piazza support private message. 
Grading:
1.	Assignments (50%)
a.	There will be 4-5 assignments. Each one is designed to test your understanding of the taught algorithms in our lectures.
b.	Each assignment includes two parts: programming and written analysis, except for the first one (a pure math assignment). You are required to submit both the code and the report. The assignments will be submitted through GT canvas. Any other submissions like email will not be considered.
c.	Although student is allowed to discuss the assignment, each student should submit their solution independently.
d.	All assignments follow the “no-late” policy. Assignments received after the due time will receive zero credit.
e.	All students are expected to follow the Georgia Tech Academic Honor Code.
2.	Project (40%) 
Each project should have a team of 4-5 students. Note that the standard will not be lowered if your team has less than 4. Please contact the instructor if your team has less than 4 members. You are encouraged to form a team on your own, otherwise I will assign you a team randomly. In the following three sections, team member need to clearly claim your contribution. If your name is not on the report or the slides, you will receive zero credit for the corresponding part.
a.	A project proposal (10%)
b.	Presentation (10%). Each team needs to grade other teams.
c.	Project report (20%)
3.	Class participation (10%)
This has two parts (5%+5%). One part is that I will publish an attendance sheet on piazza and you need to sign there. The other part is based on how active you are on piazza as an encouragement of asking and answering questions.

<p>This course introduces techniques in machine learning with an
emphasis on <em>algorithms and their applications to real-world
data</em>. We will investigate the following question: how to computationally extract useful
knowledge from data for decision making and task support? We
will focus on machine learning methods, which are organized into three parts:</p>
